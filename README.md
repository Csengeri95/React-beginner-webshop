#  React App

A beginner guitar webshop website made by me. On the main page you will find the introductory text, below the reviews. On the guitars page you will find six guitars (which can be sorted), which you can click on to go to the guitar page where you can see its features. You can add them to a basket by specifying the quantity, and the products you want to buy are shown on the Cart page. The logo is my own creation.
